          <p><i>Origami is an ancient art form that is believed to have been around for nearly 2000 years, derived from the Japanese 
             tradition of paper-folding. Though they were not the first to experiment with the culture of paper-folding, they were the 
             first to use this technique as a style of art. As you can imagine, it’s had quite a lucrative history and is deeply embedded 
             in Japanese culture. For the initial 1500 years or so of its existence, origami was actually known as orikata, a Japanese 
             word that translates to “Folded Paper”. It was in 1880 that the name of the art form was changed to origami, derived from 
             two Japanese words; oru, meaning to fold, and kami, meaning paper. The reason for the change in this term has been attributed 
             to the easiness of writing the characters for this word, which made it more viable to teach to school children. Paper 
             was originally created sometime around 100 A.D. While paper is considered a common and cheap commodity now, at the time 
             of its conception, the resources required to create paper were not as easily available. Paper was an expensive and rare 
             commodity, so those engaging in the art of traditional paper folding was usually an art left for the elite rungs of society. 
             Conversely, it was also used by Buddhist Monks for religious purposes. It only later became a practice open to the public.
             Speaking of surprising uses, one very important function origami plays is in Japanese Wedding Rituals. Origami Butterflies 
             and other simple designs are often given along with gifts and paper wrapping, but most important is the presentation of 1000 
             paper cranes.There are two manners in which this marriage tradition is known to be carried out. The first is the practice 
             of sembazuru, an age-old ritual in which the soon-to-be-wed couple folds the cranes themselves, to be strung up and decorate 
             their wedding hall. Another tradition that used to be followed was the gifting of 1000 cranes to the bride-to-be from her 
             father. These traditions come from the belief that folding of 1000 cranes would grant the holder with one special wish.
